# Rideshare

## Overview
This project explores a community rideshare pilot for UNM-Taos. The effort aims to
improve mobility access for students and residents, validate operational feasibility,
and collect insights that can guide a larger rollout. Major workstreams focus on pilot
program design, matching algorithms, rider and driver experience planning, and the
technical infrastructure required to support field operations.

## Documentation Map
- [Deterministic Matching Plan](docs/deterministic_matching_plan.md): Describes the
  deterministic approach to pairing riders and drivers, including matching logic and
  operational considerations.
- [Zone-Based Matching Plan](docs/zone_based_matching_plan.md): Outlines a zone-oriented
  pilot concept covering product features, technical stack, and implementation roadmap.
